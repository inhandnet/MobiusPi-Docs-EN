![](images/2020-01-02-10-39-40.png)
 &nbsp;

  After you select a template, VS Code automatically adds the files included in the template to the current project directory.
![](images/2020-01-02-10-42-36.png)

### Coding
The standard project template helloworld-template can print a "hello world!" log on IG500 every 10s, import configuration files to modify log content. To change the App name, modify the code in `main.py` and `setup.py` as follows: <font color=#FF0000>(Note: The Python App names cannot contain spaces.) </font>
![](images/2020-01-02-16-21-11.png)
![](images/2020-01-02-16-22-29.png)

### Debugging
#### Set Up an SFTP Connection
Before debugging code remotely, you need to upload the local code to a remote server, namely, the IG500. Before uploading the code, ensure that the debug mode of IG500 has been enabled as follows:
![](images/2020-01-02-16-24-51.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 1: Open the `sftp.json` file.
  Enter `>SFTP:Config` on the command interface to open the `sftp.json` file.
![](images/2020-01-02-16-25-48.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Configure the SFTP connection.
  In the `sftp.json` file, configure the SFTP connection according to the parameters on the Edge Computing > Python Edge Computing > Edge Computing Engine interface.
  <font color=#FF0000>Note: The Python App name must be the same as the App name in `mian.py`. </font>

  ![](images/2020-01-02-16-35-26.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 3: When the configuration is completed and saved, enter `>SFTP:Open SSH in Terminal` on the command interface to connect to the remote server.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-14-52.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 4: You are prompted to enter the SFTP server's IP address, namely, host.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-15-28.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 5: If it is the first time to set up the SFTP connection, the TERMINAL window displays a message asking you whether to continue the connection. Enter Yes and press Enter. Enter `>SFTP:Open SSH in Terminal` and SFTP server's IP address on the command interface again.
![](./images/2019-12-05-16-56-59.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 6: When the TERMINAL window prompts you to enter the password, you only need to copy the password in the `sftp.json` file.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-23-14.png)
 &nbsp;

  When the SFTP connection is successfully set up with IG500, the following information is displayed:
![](images/2020-01-02-18-23-49.png)

#### Debug Code
- Step 1: Synchronize code.
  After the SFTP connection is set up, right-click on a blank space in the left area and choose Sync Local > Remote from the shortcut menu to synchronize the local code to the remote server. After the code is synchronized, the modification or deletion of the local code will also be synchronized to the remote server.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-24-27.png)
 &nbsp;

  You can check whether the remote server has received the App code in TERMINAL window. Enter the following commands in the TERMINAL window to show the uploaded App folder information:
  ```
  cd app  
  ls -l
  ```
  ![](images/2020-01-02-18-25-11.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Debug the script in the TERMINAL window.
  After the code is synchronized, enter the command as follows to run the script on IG500. When the script is running, check whether the running result in the TERMINAL window printing "hello world!".
  ```
  python -m ptvsd --host 192.168.1.1 --port 3000 HelloWorld/src/main.py 
  ```
  - `192.168.1.1`: IP address of FE 0/1 on IG500
  - `3000`: recommended debugging port number
  - `HelloWorld/src/main.py`: execution path of `mian.py`, which should be modified according to your needs.  <br/>
&nbsp;

  The Python development environment of IG500 has a built-in ptvsd dependent library for remote code debugging. To learn about more usage information about ptvsd plug-in, see [ptvsd usage](https://github.com/microsoft/ptvsd/).

- Step 3: After debugging is completed, press `Ctrl + C` on terminal to terminate the debugging.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-30-13.png)

### Construct App Release Package
When the debugging is completed, you can construct the App release package so that the App can be quickly deployed to other IG500s.
- Step 1: Construct an App release package.
  Run the `build_py_app.sh HelloWorld` command in the TERMINAL window to construct an App release package, namely, the build_py_app.sh Python App name.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-31-55.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Download the App release package.
  An App release package is automatically generated in the build directory on the remote server. Right-click the local build folder and click Download Folder to download the constructed App release package for future deployment.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-32-25.png)
 &nbsp;

  After the download is completed, you can see the HelloWorld App release package in the build directory.
![](images/2020-01-02-18-32-54.png)

### Deploy App on the InGateway Web Page
After you run the App release package construction command, the App is automatically generated on the connected IG500, but this APP cannot be started normally. Please follow the procedure to deploy APP to IG500:
- Step 1: Upload the App.
  Choose Edge Computing > Python Edge Computing > Application Program > Configure on the IG500, and click the add button.
![](images/2020-01-03-09-38-24.png)
 &nbsp;

  Select the HelloWorld release package in the build directory.
![](images/2020-01-03-09-38-57.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Enable the App.
  After the upload, select the Enable checkbox of HelloWorld and click Submit. Then the App automatically runs and will run every time the IG500 is started.
![](images/2020-01-03-10-56-50.png)
 &nbsp;

  On the App status interface, you can see that the App has successfully run on the IG500. The HelloWorld App deployment is completed.
![](images/2020-01-03-10-59-08.png)

### Check App Status
Choose Edge Computing > Python Edge Computing > Application Program > Status on the IG500. You can see the running status of the App.
![](images/2020-01-03-10-59-41.png)

Click the log viewing icon to display the running log of the App.
![](images/2020-01-03-11-00-15.png)
![](./images/2019-12-05-14-54-03.png)
### Update Configuration File for App
- Step 1: Modify the configuration file.
  Modify ```description:"hello world!"``` in the config.yaml file of the App into  ```description: "hello inhand!"```.  
![](./images/2019-12-05-14-54-34.png) <br/>
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Import the configuration file and restart the App.
  Choose Edge Computing > Python Edge Computing > Application Program > Configure on the IG500, import the modified configuration file of HelloWorld, and restart the App.  
![](images/2020-01-03-11-02-39.png)
![](images/2020-01-03-11-02-59.png)
 &nbsp;

After the restart, the HelloWorld App runs with the modified configuration file. That is, it prints a "hello inhand!" log every 10s.  
![](./images/2019-12-06-15-20-04.png)
### Appendix
#### Use pip to Install the Dependent Library for App
To install the dependent library for App with pip, you need to enable the debugging mode for the IG500 and connect the IG500 to the Internet.
![](images/2020-01-03-11-03-50.png)
![](images/2020-01-03-11-30-19.png)
- Step 1: Use VS Code to set up an SFTP connection with the IG500. For details, see [Set Up an SFTP Connection](https://ingateway-development-docs-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/QuickStart.html#set-up-an-sftp-connection).
![](images/2020-01-03-11-07-08.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Run pip install + dependent library name + ==version number + -t + lib folder path of the App, and press Enter to install the dependent library. (If the version number is not included, pip automatically installs the dependent library of the latest version.) 
  ```
  pip install xlrd==1.2.0 -t /var/user/app/HelloWorld/lib/
  ```

  ![](images/2020-01-03-11-28-22.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 3: The dependent library is automatically downloaded and installed. When the installation is successful, the following information is displayed.
![](images/2020-01-03-11-32-51.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 4: Run the `export` command to set the environment variables for the App. Run the following commands in the TERMINAL window.
  ```
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/var/user/app/HelloWorld/lib/  
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/var/user/app/HelloWorld/lib/
  ```
  ![](images/2020-01-03-11-37-25.png)
 &nbsp;

  If a dependent library is installed for the App, you must configure the environment variables for the App before debugging; otherwise, the App cannot run normally during debugging.   
  When the App does not run on the IG500, the App uses initial environment variables. When the App runs, the environment variables of the dependent library in the lib folder are automatically added.<br/>
 &nbsp;

- Step 5: Execute code to ensure that the App runs normally.
  ![](images/2020-01-03-11-39-45.png)

#### Enable Automatic Code Completion
To improve the coding efficiency, enable automatic code completion by using Python extended plug-ins.
- Step 1: Choose File > Preferences > Settings.
![](images/2020-01-03-14-06-54.png)
 &nbsp;

- Step 2: Choose Extensions > Python. Find out Auto Complete: Extra Paths and click Edit in setting.json.
![](images/2020-01-03-14-08-11.png)
 &nbsp;

  Add the following items to settings.json and save the settings (python.pythonPath is the installation path of the Python interpreter.)
  ```

#### FAQs
- Q1: What Can I Do If the Remote Host Key Is Change and Verification Fails During the Setup of an SFTP Connection?
![](images/2020-01-03-14-28-23.png)
 &nbsp;

  A1: The possible reason is that the key of IG500 has been changed, but the key on the PC has not been updated. Therefore, the verification fails. You only need to delete the conflict line in the key file. (Pressing Ctrl and clicking the conflict item at the same time can quickly access the link.)
![](images/2020-01-03-14-32-17.png)
 &nbsp;

  After the deletion, run the `>SFTP:Open SSH in Terminal` command again to create the SFTP connection.
![](images/2020-01-03-14-34-03.png)
 &nbsp;

- Q2: After the SFTP Connection Is Successfully Set Up, I Right-Click the Blank Space in the Left Area, and Choose Sync Local > Remote to Synchronize Code to the Remote Server. However, All Authentication Methods Fail. What Can I Do?
![](images/2020-01-03-14-36-41.png)
 &nbsp;

  A2: Ensure that the password in the sftp.json file is the same as the password of the IG500. Then set up the SFTP connection and synchronize code again.
