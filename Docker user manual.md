# InGateway902 Docker user manual
InGateway902 series edge computing gateway (IG902 for short) supports manage docker images. You can publish your docker images to IG902 to quickly deploy and run applications developed by yourself. In order to introduce how to use IG902's Docker environment, this document will demonstrate how to run an Nginx image on IG902. This image is used for open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP protocols, and load balancer, HTTP cache And web server.  <br/>
Docker is an open source application container engine that allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a portable container and then publish it to any popular Linux machine or Windows machine. It can also be virtualized. The container is completely with the sandbox mechanism, there will be no interface between each other.

## Prepare IG902 Hardware and Network Environment
### Connect IG902 to the Power Source and to a PC with a Network Cable
Connect IG902 to the power source and to a PC with an Ethernet cable according to the topology diagram.   <br/>
